Long Term Scientific and Social Concerns on the Use of Plants Genetically Modified for Glyphosate Resistance

Although brief, the history of Genetic Engineering has been plagued with controversies   ( Long 1 )   .  One of the first instances of genetic modification of plants occurred in 1984 when corn was fertilized via in vitro fertilisation in a lab in the Washington. ( Vrain ).  After this, many achievements occurred in the field; but remained largely unpublished due to competition between companies ( Vrain ).  This harsh, competitive, corporate environment without communication between biotechnology firms remains to this day ( Vrain ).  Finally, after a 10 year race to market between the biotech firms genetic modification of plants finally made it out of the lab and onto the shelves of supermarkets everywhere  in the form of FlavrSavr tomatoes which would stay good for almost two months after normal tomatoes would have become inedible ( Guruswamy, 465 )   .  Many people took issue with this , considering it unnatural and therefore “bad for you”; but unfortunately due to a concept Vrain called substantial equivalence genetically modified plants could not be regulated until 2004, when European Commision’s “regulations on GM food and Feed became ratified”in April of 2004    ( Guruswamy 471 ).  Since labels were not required on food, there was no controversy up until this point but right after this there was a massive movement to organic foods and G.M.O-free

( Genetically Modified Organism )    regions were established in Europe and the Americas          ( Vrain ) .  The problem is during the time period between 1984 and 2004, genetic engineering companies put billions of dollars into research and products, most of which are “grandfathered in”.  Because of this, there has been much controversy over the use of these unregulated, or in many cases under regulated foods in “forced” diets such as school lunches, or in prisons               ( Vrain ).  This move from a quiet competitive industry to a industry with much controversy and discussion on a public level has caused many scientists, like Vrain to leave in search for a  more honest line of work.  Overall, Genetic Engineering can be considered one of the most controversial industries of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

Genetically modified plants are also causing an abundance of glyphosate resistant weeds that are killing crops ( “Modified” Scientific American 87-88 ).   Prior to the development of Genetically Modified Plants, farmers had to go to every individual plant and use a paintbrush to apply glyphosate to weeds, however upon the development of products like roundup ready, an array of seeds glyphosate is dropped by the gallon on entire fields ( Vrain )   .  Unfortunately the same reason this works so well is also causing the problems, although scientists disagree on whether glyphosate resistance is caused by Evolutionary pressures ( Adler 301 )    or Interbreeding between weeds and plants, it is fact that it now takes seven times as much herbicide to kill weeds than it did at the dawn of genetic engineering  ( “Modified” Scientific American, 96).  This leads to significantly higher food prices worldwide, and because of the detrimental effects of genetic engineering on herbicide resistance, it is much harder to pass good

 Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMO )    such as rice with increased vitamin E to stop blindness in people in third world countries ( “Rice” Biotechnology 62 ).  It is therefore obvious that the use of glyphosate resistant crops is doing more harm than good and all activities using such crops should cease immediately.

In addition to causing an abundance of glyphosate resistant weeds, Genetically modifying Crops have introduced an abundance of contamination of organic foods causing widespread public concern .  This sudden concern is happening partially because of substantial increases in obesity causing the public to become very health conscious ( Culter 11-13 ) .  The wide availability of these statistics has lead to an exponential increase in organic, and natural food purchases ( Vrain ) .  Unfortunately for the consumers of  these organic foods, due to the dawn of genetic engineering, it has become impossible to truly certify any food as organic.  As part of their reproduction life cycle plants crossbreed, and when one genetically modified plant breeds with one “organic” plant, the resulting offspring is genetically modified, and therefore inorganic.  Through this process, genetically modified traits in plants can be spread across entire countries in a matter of a few seasons as has occurred with glyphosate resistant superweeds ( Vrain  ).  Unfortunately, nothing can be done to stop genetically modified crops that have already been released into the wild (Guruswamy).  However, governments and individuals alike can learn from these mistakes and enforce stronger regulations in the future.  From this, it is discernable that the detrimental effects of genetically modifying plants to be glyphosate resistant on contamination of organic foods far outway any good done by them.
